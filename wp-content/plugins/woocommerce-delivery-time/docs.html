The plugin uses jQuery Datepicker with Timepicker addon, so you'll have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Restrict dates

This is the most powerful weapon the plugin supports. With this feature, you're able to provide shipping to customers in only some certain days/months.

All you need to do is enter your rules into the textarea box.

**You have to following this guide:**

- You can enter **only one rule per line**
- Each rule must be a single date or a single date range
- Date must be formatted in USA format, e.g. `mm/dd/yyyy`
- Date range must be formatted: `mm/dd/yyyy - mm/dd/yyyy` (e.g. `fromDate - toDate`)
- You can use stars (*) for day, month or year, which means any day, any month or any year

Examples:

**Single date**

Format | Meaning
--- | ---
`5/12/2013` | No shipping on May 12th, 2013
`1/1/*` | No shipping on January 1st of any year (New Year)
`8/*/2013` | No shipping in October, 2013
`*/1/2014` | No shipping on first day of any month of 2014
`12/*/*` | No shipping in December of any year
`*/1/*` | No shipping on first day of any month of any year
`*/*/2013` | No shipping in 2013 at all

**Date range**

Date range is just combination of from date and to date. Each date in the range must be well-formatted as single date.

Format | Meaning
--- | ---
`5/12/2013 - 6/1/2013` | No shipping from May 12th, 2013 to June 1st, 2013
`12/24/* - 1/1/*` | No shipping from December 24th to January 1st of **next year**
`6/*/* - 8/*/*` | No shipping from June to October of any year
`*/1/* - */5/*` | No shipping on first 5 days of any month of any year
`8/*/* - 12/1/*` | No shipping from August to December 1st of any year
`1/15/* - 2/*/*` | No shipping from January 15th to February
`*/25/* - */1/*` | No shipping from 25th to 1st day of **next month**

## Restrict by week days

Beside restricting dates by rules above, you can restrict by week days. Just select which days you don't want to provide shipping from the checkbox list and save.

## Restrict by hours

You can limit the hours when customers can get their goods delivered. This is very convenience for shop with high quality of delivering.

## Restrict sequence days from today

You can disable datetime picker for some days, counting from today.

For ex.:

- `0`: disable today
- `1`: disable today and tomorrow

If you don't enter any value, the plugin will disables all past days, e.g. before today.

## Disable time

Sometimes you don't want users to select time for delivery, only dates. Since version 2.1.3, the plugin supports that.
